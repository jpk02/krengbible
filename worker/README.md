# krengbible Cloudflare Worker

Source for the Worker at `krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev`.  This repo is the source of truth — deploy with `wrangler`, or from the Actions tab (see below).

## What changed in the Korean search rewrite

**Before:** `/search/ko` looped through up to 1189 chapters, doing a serial `KV.get()` per chapter.  Cold queries took 10s+; pagination beyond the first page took 30–50s; verses in never-visited chapters were silently un-searchable.

**After:** A pre-built flat index lives in KV at `nkrv_search_index` — one JSON blob, roughly 5 MB, containing every verse as `[bookIdx, chapter, verse, cleanText]`.  The Worker loads it once per isolate (cold start ~100ms) into a module-level cache, then every query is in-memory `includes()` + `slice()`.  Sub-100ms per query regardless of page.

If the index hasn't been built yet, `/search/ko` returns HTTP 503 with `{"error":"index_not_built"}` rather than silently returning partial results.  This is intentional — if you ever wipe the KV namespace, search visibly breaks until you rebuild.

## Required env vars / bindings

Already present in this Worker:

- `COMMENTARY_KV` — KV namespace binding
- `ESV_TOKEN` — ESV API token
- `ANTHROPIC_KEY` — Anthropic API key

**Add:**

- `ADMIN_SECRET` — any random string.  Required to call the `/admin/*` endpoints below.  Set it as a Worker secret (Settings → Variables and Secrets → Add → "Secret").

## Deploying

`wrangler.toml` carries the account id, worker name, KV binding and cron
triggers, so a deploy is one command from the `worker/` directory:

```bash
cd worker && npx wrangler deploy
```

The dashboard copy-paste workflow is retired.  Don't edit the Worker in the
dashboard editor — this repo is the source of truth, and a dashboard edit is
silently overwritten by the next deploy.

### Deploying without a terminal

`npx wrangler deploy` needs a machine with npm access, which a Claude Code
cloud session does not necessarily have: those run behind an egress proxy, and
unless the environment's network policy allows `registry.npmjs.org`, npm cannot
fetch `wrangler` at all (`403 Forbidden - GET
https://registry.npmjs.org/wrangler`).  Cloudflare's own API is reachable; npm
is the only thing in the way.

`.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` runs that same command on GitHub's
runners instead: Actions tab → Deploy Worker → Run workflow.  That path needs no
machine at all, so a deploy can be triggered from a phone.

It is manual only, by design — a push to `main` ships nothing on its own, so
deploying stays as deliberate as typing `wrangler deploy`.

It needs one repository secret, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Settings → Secrets
and variables → Actions), holding a token with the **Edit Cloudflare Workers**
permissions.  Everything else comes from `wrangler.toml`.

The workflow deliberately does not run on `pull_request`: this repo is public,
and a fork PR must never get a run that can read that token.

After deploying it runs `worker/smoke.sh`, which requires HTTP 200 and a
plausible response size from the six reader-facing routes.  A deploy can
succeed and still serve a broken route, so the run is not green until those
answer.  Run the same check by hand any time:

```bash
cd worker && ./smoke.sh
```

If it fails, the bad version is already live — roll back:

```bash
cd worker && npx wrangler rollback
```

The run's "Record current version" step logs the deployment list from just
before the deploy, so the version to return to is in the log.

One smoke failure is not a bad deploy: `/search/ko` returning 503 means the
KV search index is missing, which is the deliberate fail-loud behavior
described above.  Rebuild the index rather than rolling back.

Secrets set with `wrangler secret put` (`ESV_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_KEY`,
`ADMIN_SECRET`, `API_BIBLE_KEY`, and the VOTD trio) persist across deploys and
never need re-entering.

## Building the English (ESV) search index

The English search now uses the same flat-index architecture as Korean, replacing the ESV `passage/search` API (which was a relevance-ranked black box that dropped obvious matches like Psalm 119:105 for "lamp").

Chunk size 250 chapters at a time, same as Korean.  Each chunk fetches the chapters from the ESV API (concurrency 8 to be polite).  After all chunks land, merge.

```bash
# Chunk 1: chapters 0-249
curl.exe "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-en-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=0&size=250"

# Chunks 2-5
curl.exe "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-en-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=250&size=250"
curl.exe "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-en-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=500&size=250"
curl.exe "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-en-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=750&size=250"
curl.exe "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-en-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=1000&size=250"

# Merge once all chunks are done
curl.exe "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/merge-en-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```

Each chunk takes 60–120s the first time (it's calling ESV ~250 times in parallel batches).  Subsequent chunks reuse the per-chapter cache (`esv_{book}_{chapter}` keys) unless you pass `&refetch=1`.

After merge, `/search/en` returns sub-second substring matches across the whole Bible — Psalm 119:105 will now show up for "lamp", and any other previously-missing matches.

## Building the Korean search index (first time, or after a wipe)

The Bible has 1189 chapters.  Building the index means walking each one, ensuring it's cached in KV, and writing flat verse tuples into chunk keys.  We do it in chunks so a single request stays well under the Worker CPU limit.

Replace `YOUR_SECRET` with your `ADMIN_SECRET` value below.  Default chunk size is 250 chapters.

```bash
# Chunk 1: chapters 0-249
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=0&size=250"

# Chunk 2
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=250&size=250"

# Chunk 3
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=500&size=250"

# Chunk 4
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=750&size=250"

# Chunk 5 (final — covers 1000-1188)
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/build-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET&from=1000&size=250"
```

Each chunk response tells you `nextFrom` (or `null` if done) so you can copy/paste the next URL straight from the JSON output.  If a chunk fetches a lot of un-cached chapters from bskorea.or.kr it can take 30–90 seconds.  Mostly-cached chunks finish in a few seconds.

When `done: true` shows up, run merge:

```bash
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/merge-index?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```

This concatenates every `nkrv_search_chunk_*` key into the final `nkrv_search_index`.  Expected output: `totalVerses: ~31000`.

## Checking status

```bash
curl "https://krengbible.pauljkim22.workers.dev/admin/index-status?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```

Returns the current index size, chunk count, and whether the current isolate has it cached.

## Rebuilding after Bible-text changes

If you ever change verse text (you almost certainly won't), re-run the chunked build with `&refetch=1` to force re-fetch from bskorea.or.kr instead of using the per-chapter KV cache.  Then merge again.

## Routes summary

| Route | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/esv/?q=...` | ESV passage lookup | Passthrough |
| `/intro/{n}` | AI book intro | KV-cached forever |
| `/commentary/{book}/{ch}` | AI chapter commentary | KV-cached forever |
| `/search/ko?q=&offset=` | Korean search | Uses pre-built index — fast |
| `/search/en?q=&page=` | English search | ESV API |
| `/search/smart?q=&lang=en\|ko&tx=&page=` | Ranked search the app uses | Scores every verse in every indexed version of the language (ESV, NIV, NLT, KJV;  개역개정, 새번역, 새한글, 우리말, and 현대인의 성경 once it has an index).  Text is returned in `tx`;  `matchedIn` names a version that matched better.  Index-only, never live |
| `/votd[?date=YYYY-MM-DD]` | Verse of the day | KV-cached ~72h.  `date` selects an ET date, clamped ET-2 through ET+1 — readers request their OWN local date, and east of Eastern that date is still a future ET one, which is what the +1 is for.  A future date used to be refused because populating it from upstream would pin the wrong verse under a write-once key;  dated requests are read-only now, so they never populate and the clamp no longer has to carry that job.  The verse for each date is written at 09:00 UTC the day before it begins anywhere, so a reader's own date is always already there.  The first verse also carries `ko` (개역개정) and `en` (ESV) text from the cached chapters when both are in KV, so the app's first open of a day needs no chapter fetch on the default translations |
| `/nkrv/{book}/{ch}` | Korean Bible chapter | KV-cached forever |
| `/admin/build-index` | Build search index chunk | Requires `secret` |
| `/admin/merge-index` | Merge chunks into final index | Requires `secret` |
| `/admin/index-status` | Inspect index state | Requires `secret` |
